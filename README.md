So this is the basic counter app that works on blockchain(Polygon).I've used hardhat for smart contract-frontend communication. Here is the links ;

I've used ReactJS and ChakraUI for frontend.
# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
